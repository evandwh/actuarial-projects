# 🧮 Actuarial Modeling Projects

Welcome! This repository showcases actuarial modeling and data analysis projects that demonstrate my skills in probability, statistics, and computational modeling using **Python**, **R**, and **SQL**.  
Each project connects to core actuarial concepts such as **loss modeling**, **risk measurement**, and **premium calculation** — key areas of exams P, FM, and beyond.

## 📂 Projects

### 1️⃣ Monte Carlo Simulation of Aggregate Claims
**Goal:** Estimate the total claim amount for an insurance portfolio using a compound distribution model.  
- Frequency modeled as N ~ Poisson(lambda)  
- Severity modeled as X_i ~ Lognormal(mu, sigma)  
- Aggregate loss S = sum X_i simulated over thousands of trials  

**Key outputs:**
- Distribution of total losses  
- Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Tail Value-at-Risk (TVaR) at 90%, 95%, and 99% confidence levels  
- Histograms and empirical CDF plots

### 2️⃣ Loss Distribution Fitting *(coming soon)*
**Goal:** Fit and compare multiple severity distributions (Gamma, Lognormal, Weibull) to claim data using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE).  
- Includes visual goodness-of-fit diagnostics and AIC/BIC comparisons.

### 3️⃣ Premium and Risk Load Calculation *(coming soon)*
**Goal:** Calculate expected loss, risk loading, and fair premium under different assumptions.  
- Uses variance and expected value principles for pricing under uncertainty.
