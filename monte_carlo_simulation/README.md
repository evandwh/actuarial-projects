# Monte Carlo Simulation for Aggregate Insurance Losses

This project simulates **aggregate insurance losses** using **Monte Carlo methods**.  
It models the **frequency** of claims with a Poisson distribution and the **severity** (amount per claim) with either a Lognormal or Gamma distribution.  
The output includes key **risk metrics** such as Value-at-Risk (VaR), Tail Value-at-Risk (TVaR), and visualizations of the loss distribution.

## üìä Overview

In insurance and actuarial science, the **aggregate loss** over a period is defined as:

\[
S = \sum_{i=1}^{N} X_i
\]

where:
- \( N \) is the number of claims (frequency),
- \( X_i \) is the severity (claim amount) for each claim.

This simulation approximates the distribution of \( S \) by generating thousands of random outcomes using **Monte Carlo simulation**.
